# Quick Test Setup - Minimal Tycoon

Since we're having compilation issues with the complex system, let's test with a minimal setup first.

## Step 1: Test Basic Claim Plot

### What to Check in Console (F1)
When you walk into the claim plot volume, you should see:

1. `"PlayerTriesToBuyButton called with button: Claim"`
2. `"Player found for agent"`  
3. `"Claim Plot Button Clicked!"`
4. `"ClaimPlotFunction called"`
5. `"No current owner - proceeding with claim"`
6. `"GetPlayerTycoonClass called for agent"`
7. Either:
   - `"Found existing player tycoon class in map"` (if working)
   - OR `"Creating new player tycoon class entry"` â†’ `"Successfully created player tycoon class"` (auto-creation)
8. `"Got player tycoon class"`  
9. `"Player not already owner - claiming now"`
10. `"Plot successfully claimed! OwnerOfTycoon set to Agent"`

## Step 2: Expected Behavior

After successful claim:
- **Claim button should disappear** (`ClaimPlotButton.Hide()` is called)
- **OwnerOfTycoon should be set** to your agent
- **UI should appear** showing 0 cash, 0 gems, 0 rebirth tokens

## Step 3: Test Money Generation

Once plot is claimed, try hitting the crate (if you have CratePropMani set up):
- Should see `"Agent Good"`
- Cash should increase by `CrateAddMoneyAmount` 
- UI should update to show new cash amount

## Step 4: Troubleshooting by Debug Message

### If you see "Failed to get manager":
- **game_manager device** is not placed in level or not working
- Try **restarting UEFN** completely

### If you see "Failed to get player tycoon class from GameManager":
- This should be fixed now with auto-creation
- If still happening, there's a deeper Verse effect issue

### If you see "Player is already owner of another tycoon":  
- Player state wasn't reset from previous test
- **Restart the game session**

### If claim button doesn't respond at all:
- **ClaimPlotVolume** not properly assigned
- **Volume doesn't surround** where you're walking
- **Handler1 subscription** not working

## Step 5: Minimal UEFN Setup

For this test, you only need:

**In your level:**
1. **game_manager** device (placed anywhere)
2. **Tycoon_Manager** device (placed in tycoon area)
3. **Claim button prop** (any prop)
4. **Claim volume** (volume_device around button)

**In Tycoon_Manager properties:**
- **ClaimPlotVolume**: Set to your volume
- **ClaimPlotButton**: Set to your claim prop
- Leave everything else as default for now

**Test sequence:**
1. Build/compile project
2. Launch in UEFN
3. Walk into claim volume  
4. Press F1 to see console output
5. Check if claim works
